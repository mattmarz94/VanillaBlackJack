# VanillaBlackJack

I used vanilla JavaScript to create a basic BlackJack casino game. 

Throughout this little game I learned and also polished my skills creating arrays and objects, implementing booleans, if else statements using comparison operators along with logical operatos and for loops. 

I refreshed my memory using the Math.random function and learned how to make the numbers non float point numbers.

Lastly, I learned to return expressions instead of console.logging information.
